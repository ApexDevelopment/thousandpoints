# 1000 Points
1000 Points is a game made with the LÃ–VE engine where you must earn a thousand points in each minigame. You have three lives, and you gain one life lost with each minigame you beat. The minigames are all based on retro games, like Pong and Space Invaders.

## How to Play
I didn't have time to code a tutorial. Most games play as you would expect.

Anywhere you see "arrow keys" assume you can also use WASD, the D pad, or a joystick direction.

### Space Invaders
Arrow keys or mouse to move. Space or click to fire.

### Pong
Arrow keys or mouse to move. Hitting the ball hard (moving the paddle quickly) causes it to move faster. This is the most surefire way to beat the bot.

### Breakout
Arrow keys or mouse to move. Hitting multiple bricks in one shot gives you combo bonus points.

### Tetris
Left and right arrow keys to move the piece. Down arrow soft drops while space hard drops, bonus points for both. Up arrow rotates. Wall kicks are implemented, but not thoroughly tested. Bonus points for clearing more than one row at once.
